# Back To Basics - C Programming for Reverse Engineering & Pwn

This repository contains my solutions to various small assignments as I learn C programming. The assignments are taken from the [Learning-C](https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C/tree/master) repository by h0mbre. My goal is to improve my understanding of C and apply this knowledge to reverse engineering and pwn challenges.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Practice and improve my C programming skills.
- Learn the fundamentals that are crucial for reverse engineering and pwn (binary exploitation).
- Build a strong foundation for tackling more complex reverse engineering and security challenges.

## Assignments

The `C` folder will contain the bulk of my C code for the assignments, which range from basic concepts like pointers and memory management to more advanced topics that are crucial in the world of reverse engineering.
